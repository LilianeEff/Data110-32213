Hello Everyone. Here is quick recap of Week 1 and then dive into the assignment details for this week.


- **Communication:**
  - We will be using  **MS Teams** for everyday communication. If you're not on there yet, let's fix that ASAP.
  - Drop me a quick message on MS Teams for anything urgent. For the big stuff, email is the way to go: rebin.muhammad@montgomerycollege.edu.

- **Media Time:**
  - Our YouTube playlist got two new additions:  [ "Why is Data Science Important?" ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO2I1gfEPgc) and  [ "The Beauty of Data Visualization."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zg-C8AAIGg)

- **Google Forms:**
  - We learned that surveys are a gold mine for data, and Google Forms is our tool. For many, it was a first-time experience crafting a form.

- **GitHub:**
  - GitHub is the place where student store dataset and share their code. We've covered the basics:
    - Signing up for GitHub.
    - Starting your own repository (Data110).
    - Sharing the repo link in a collaborative Excel file.
    - Creating a folder named 'dataset'.
    - Uploading 'happiness.csv' to our dataset.

- **Markdown:**
  - We introduced Markdown - since  use it in  GitHub, Google Colab, and Jupyter Notebook content later. 
  - **Your Task:** Craft a 'Markdown-Exercise.md' file on GitHub.
